# Scenario

# The code in the editor contains comments. Try to improve it: add or remove
# comments where you find it appropriate (yes, sometimes removing a
# comment can make the code more readable), and change variable names
# where you think this will improve code comprehension.

# this program computesthe number ofsecondsin a given number of hours
# this program has been written two days ago
a = 2 # number of hours
seconds = 3600 # number of secondsin 1 hour
print("Hours: ", a) 
print("Seconds in Hours: ", a * seconds) 
print ("Goodbye")
#this is the end of the program that computes the number of secondsin 3hrs
print(3*3600)
